# App-for-Depression-and-Anxiety
application- “Feel Peace” which basically helps a specific person to counter a disorder like Depression or Anxiety. As all the Adults and Teenagers are facing 
such problems in this lockdown and pandemic. Due to this so many lives had left the world.

Basically It has a login and signup page which is connected to the firebase console. After logging in It has question round which has 10 questions about the personal 
lives of the user. So there is animation to change the question and at the end of this activity there is a score generator where for every positive answer its plus 
one and for negative its zero So basically this rating is like Less Score Less Anxiety. At the end we have also provided the feedback form and also the button to go 
on a website where experts listens to them and help them with their problems
So thats it

Happy Coding :)
